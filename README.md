## Arrays - My Custom Arrays 
Arrays in Kotlin are mutable and have a "fixed size"


Difference between Constructors And Init Blocks In Kotlin 


1- Primary Constructor: It's called firstly when object initiated 
## Example 

"class CustomArray( Primary Constructor Section )"

2- Init Block: it's called after primary constructor to initiate the values that not initiated from primary constructor.

## Example
init {
 
}

3- Secondary Constructor : it's called after primary and init block

## Example 

constructor()
